# Sample-Sort-CUDA
Sample Sort in CUDA
* This was done as an assignment for DS 295: Parallel Programming in Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science.
* I couldn't achieve speed up in this case, because of less numbers used for sorting.
* The overhead for communication and synchronization surpassed the sorting overhead because of small array size.
* Try with large array (of the order ob billions) to achieve speedup.
